#Introduction
Welcome to my simon clone. Using basic html css and some javascript logic I've been able to faithfully recreate a childhood favorite game of mine, but with some added flavor.

##Technologies used
html
css
javascript

###How to Play
This is your basic Simon Says game with a HipHop twist! Using your favorite rapper's adlibs follow the pattern and see how far you can get! The game features a roster of 10 world famous MC's of which you can pick 4. Once you pick your players start the game which triggers a random pattern of clicks, starting with one, but adding one with every successful turn. Follow the random pattern up to twenty-five and you win. Mess up along the way and you have to start over from the beginning. Good Luck!
