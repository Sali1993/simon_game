### Introduction
Welcome to my simon clone. Using basic html css and some javascript logic I've been able to faithfully recreate a childhood favorite game of mine, but with some added flavor.

### How to Play
This is your basic Simon Says game with a HipHop twist! Using your favorite rapper's adlibs follow the pattern and see how far you can get! The game features a roster of 10 world famous MC's of which you can pick 4. Once you pick your players start the game which triggers a random pattern of clicks, starting with one, but adding one with every successful turn. Follow the random pattern up to twenty-five and you win. Mess up along the way and you have to start over from the beginning. Good Luck!

###### MVP Goals
- As a player, I want each color to have a unique tone as to help keep track of the patterns
- As a player, I want a level progression tally on the screen in order to track progress through the game
- As a player, I want an instruction prompt on the screen, as a reminder of who's turn it is and how long the pattern has become

###### Stretch Goals
- As a player, I would like the game to give diffent messages as you progress futher in the game.
- As a player, I would like the game to have background music and diffenent congratulatory sounds at various checkpoints throughout the game  
- As a player, I would like a replay button to hear and see the pattern again
- As a player, I would like each round to be timed and if I fail to complete the challenge in time there is a "You Lose" animation that resets the game

### Hurdles & Future goals
- The majority of the time was spent creating the javascript logic, initially I created smaller functions that controlled the different individual aspects of the game(ie, starting the game, playing each sound, adding to the pattern,etc...)
- I was able to cobmine the smaller functions into lager more efficient functions to make the game easier to play and the code more dry
- I am currently still working on combining some of the smaller functions that control the button clicks
- I am also in the process of adding a replay button and a personal best section to the game
